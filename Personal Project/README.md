Personal Project

For this project I built a personal blog using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.

How to run and test the site locally:

Clone the repository that the project is located in: “Tester”.
Navigate to the folder named “Personal Project” and ‘cd’ into it.
Go to the “index.html” and start the local server.
Run the website in a web browser, preferably Google Chrome.
