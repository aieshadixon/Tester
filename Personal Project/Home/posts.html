            <h1>Why I Love Matcha.</h1>
            <p class="post-date">22 OCT 2023</p>
            </div>
<p class="poem"> <em>Matcha came to me when coffee was all I had.
Matcha makes me feel things I have never felt before.
Matcha gives me a new outlook on life, 
And brings me joy when I am feeling low.
I love matcha and I hope matcha loves me too.</em></p>

<br/>

<p>Above is a short and simple poem that I spontaneously wrote one day to express my love for Matcha. Random, I know. But it seems to be one of the only things that I’m passionate about these days. 
</p><br/>
<p>(I should say now that when I mention the word ‘matcha’, I am referring to matcha latte rather than matcha tea, which doesn’t incorporate milk)
</p><br/>
<p>I remember the first time I tried Matcha was when I ordered food from a place called Egg Drop whilst I was studying abroad in South Korea. The thing that led up to ordering the beverage was the fact that I wanted to try it out after seeing people on social media drinking it. I was curious and was in the mood to try something new considering I was in a different country across the world.
</p><br/>
<p>If I remember correctly, the drink was labelled as Jeju Green Tea Latte which essentially meant that the green tea leaves were grown and harvested on Jeju Island, a small island off the south coast of Korea. The ‘Latte’ part refers to the milk that is combined with the grounded tea leaves to make a delicious milky green tea enthused beverage that can be served hot or cold. In this case, I chose the hot option. 
</p><br/>
<p>Everytime I try a new superfood - which matcha is labelled as - I research the benefits of it for my body. There is something so gratifying about knowing that you are nourishing your body with foods and drinks that actually taste good. With Matcha, I found out that it is a great alternative to coffee as it delivers similar benefits with added benefits, like being high in antioxidants that can help prevent disease.
</p><br/>
<p>Always purchase either the premium grade or ceremonial grade matcha powder for better taste quality. The quality of the matcha powder decreases when you buy anything below those grades. Your matcha will end up being not very enjoyable.
</p><br/>
<p>The brand of matcha that I have been loving is from the brand Clearspring. Their premium grade matcha powder is the best tasting one that i’ve tried so far in my matcha journey. 
</p><br/>
<p>I can tell when the matcha latte is going to taste good depending on the richness of the green colour. If the matcha is a deep green then, it is likely that too much matcha powder has been used or there isn’t enough milk in it, making the drink taste quite bitter if you don’t like that grassy taste. Alternatively, if the colour is too light - almost the same colour as the milk you put in it - then you’ve used too much milk, unless again, that is your preference. Personally, I like my matcha latte to be somewhere in the middle of those colours, with one and a half teaspoon of honey for some added sweetness. Ugh, delicious.

                <h1>Afrofuturism</h1>
                <p class="post-date">19 SEP 2023</p>
                <p>Let's talk about Afrofuturism. Throughout history, black people have been the pioneers and inventors of many great things. Afrofuturism is one of those great things. It is a genre that intertwines black culture with science fiction, technology, and history. This fantastical combination is portrayed through literature, music, and art - specifically visual art.</p>
<br/>
<p>Afrofuturism has its roots in black activism and 1980s technoculture. The term Afrofuturism was first coined by Mark Dery in 1993. It is as some say, a mix of the past, present, and future.
</p><br/>
<p>I am captivated by the sheer greatness that the afrofuturistic aesthetic exudes. It extraordinarily showcases the imagination and creativity of black people. Black culture is rich with diversity, so why not celebrate it in such a way?

It is important because it is a genre solely based on the African diaspora. 

There is also an element of escapism. Given the deep-rooted struggles and hardships of black people throughout history and modern society, Afrofuturism creates a place for freedom and liberation. 

I am provided with a renewed sense of love for my heritage. </p>

    <h1> Travelling as a black person</h1>
                <p class="post-date">16 AUG 2023</p>
            <p>There have been many times where I have come across TikTok videos or Tweets discussing the topic of travelling whilst black. The post would often say something like “I was racially discriminated against in …” or “These are the countries I felt uncomfortable in as a black person”. Alongside this, the comments sections are always filled with people sharing their own racist experiences in the countries mentioned. 
                <br/>
                <p><strong>Anti-blackness</strong></p> 
                <br/>
                <p>Anti-blackness is a universal issue that takes place around the world. Some would say that it is rooted in hatred towards … There is a mindset that associates blackness with evil and whiteness with innocence. In
                     Shakespeare’s Othello for example, the language that is used to describe Othello is a 
                     stark contrast to that which describes Desdemona. The animalistic language used in 
                     association with Othello makes him appear inhumane; a beast. Black people were and still
                      are treated as animals who are undeserving of all that is good.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p>When you really think about it, discriminating against someone because of the skin they were born in is completely ridiculous. Skin colour can’t be simply rubbed off.
                     <p><strong>Where are Black people less likely to face racism?</strong>
                        <br/>
                    <p>The obvious answer would be places within Africa or the Caribbean where black people make up the majority of the population. 
                     <p>Everyone’s experience is different.</p>

  <h1>I Don't Want To Be A Strong Black Woman</h1>
  <p class="post-date">7 JUL 2023</p>
  <p>A thought came to me one day whilst I was thinking about my purpose in this world. As I've become more attuned to the world around me and learnt about my place in it, 
    I’ve become aware that there is a problem with the way black women are treated. It is common black women to be labelled as loud and aggressive.
     It is also common for us to be labelled as strong and independent, words given to us as a compliment. Do you notice a theme?</p>

<br/>
<p>I want to be able to show my vulnerability and fragility without being dismissed.</p>

<p>It is scary and disheartening to read stories about medical racism within maternity hospitals. How black women are not taken seriously when they are in pain during childbirth, and are instead delayed the relief that they need because we are supposed to be these “unbreakable” and “tough” beings. (insert statistics)
It has come to a point where not even healthcare professionals can be trusted to care for us at our most vulnerable moments.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Femininity</strong></p>
<p>Society harmfully regards black women’s bodies as masculine. Look at what they did to Serena Williams during her tennis playing days for example. Femininity is not considered when black women are in the picture, especially when we don't fit the body type standards.
Instead, we get compared to our male counterparts and placed in a box labelled unattractive.
For a lot of black women, our femininity is what liberates us and gives us freedom to express ourselves. This, however, threatens those who have no understanding of what it is to be a black woman, and instead comes across as being intimidating? </p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Misogynoir </strong></p>
<p>The strong black woman stereotype can be rooted in Misogynoir. It is a term that describes the discrimination against black women, is rampant amongst… and it is being allowed to stay rampant because no one is looking out for us. Our voices are fighting to be heard, but they are still overlooked.
<br/>
<p>Microaggressions in school and the workplace that are played off as banter when really they are making a mockery out of us.
</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Colourism </strong></p>
<p>I feel as though colourism also has a part to play in this. Black women who have darker skin are considered more masculine, unattractive, and thick-skinned.

  <h1>Mallorca</h1>
  <p class="post-date">4 JUN 2023</p>
  <p>Mallorca is a spanish island located in the bellaric sea with a population of ... The island's beautiful beaches and all year round warm weather make it a popular holiday destination. </p>
<p>The following are some of the places that I visited on my trip to Mallorca in 2022.</p>



<p>Cala Major is such an iconic location - for me anyway. There is so much happening in the area and everything you need is close by: Beach Restaurants Transport Supermarkets The locals are friendly and you feel this warmth from them that makes you want to return there on your next visit. 

I was captivated by the stunning views of the sea and the warm-hued sunsets in the evenings. Walking the streets of Cala Major made me feel like I was living the highlife except with the richness of LIFE. I felt really immersed in the island lifestyle.</p>

<p>Take a bus from the busy city centre of Palma de Mallorca to the charming village of Valldemossa. There you can find souvenir shops, beautiful stone buildings and gorgeous scenery. 

Visit one of the local cafes and treat yourself to a fruity and refreshing glass of sangria whilst you sit and enjoy the atmosphere. Pair it with a ..., native to Valldemossa with its bun like appearance and surprisingly sweet flavour that makes you want to eat more than one at a time. 

This place is oozing with character.</p>


<p>You can take a bus from Valldemossa to Deia. The journey involves driving along winding roads that wrap around the ... mountains. 

Be sure to sit on the left side of the bus to get the best view of the spectacular scenery outside. 

As the journey takes your higher up the mountains, you will be able to see the glistening blue waters down below.

I recommend visiting the restaurant called... It is a Thai restaurant with an amazing view that overlooks the greenery of the trees and mountains surrounding the area.</p>


<p>An hour long journey from Palma will lead you to the beautiful town of Soller.

Take a ride on the Soller train to Centre Comercial, where you will find independent shops and cafes as well as a cathedral.

I recommend going to ... which specialises in traditional Mallorquin food. There is also a weekly market that takes place every Saturday from 9am to 2pm with individual stalls selling local goods.</p>

<p>Of course the island of Mallorca has a lot more to offer, however, these are the places that I experienced.</p>

  <h1>Is Genderless Fashion The Future?</h1>
  <p class="post-date">17 APR 2023</p>
  <p>
    Genderless fashion has been around for quite some time, but it is in recent years that we have seen it become mainstream. As fashion is an ever-changing entity, we see trends coming in and out. It seems that as time goes on, we are becoming more comfortable with expressing ourselves and making a statement with the use of clothing. The move towards unisex and genderless clothing is representing the fluidity of fashion. But then again, it isn’t really a move because these clothes have always been there.
  </p>
  <br/>
<p>I remember when Jaden Smith – whose Father is the well-known actor Will Smith – received negative comments about his gender-fluid way of dressing back in 2016. This came at a time when genderless fashion was still unfamiliar. Now in 2022, we are seeing more and more celebrity figures - namely Harry Styles - who are breaking down stereotypes to do with the way we dress.
</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Genderless vs Unisex</strong>
</p>
<br/>
<p>Is there a difference between genderless fashion and unisex fashion? The short answer is yes. According to Lifestyle Asia, genderless fashion is "bending fashion rules and picking what you want to wear". Whereas Unisex fashion seeks to accommodate both masculine and feminine styles of clothing, by putting them together "under one umbrella term".
</p>
<br/>
<p><strong> it tradition or a mindset?</strong>
</p>
<br/>
<p>In society, we have always associated certain clothing items to belong to a certain gender. For example, dresses are for women and trousers are for men. But where did this idea originate from? It is similar to the concept of colours being gendered; blue is for boys and pink is for girls. Such concepts are implemented from childhood. Again, who orchestrated this?
<br/>
<p>For generations, tradition has shackled freedom. However, with the upsurge of Millennials and Gen Z, I have seen the rise of a non-conforming mindset that has been adopted into fashion. 
</p>
<br/>
<p>
That is not to say that this type of rebellion has happened before. Look at the generation of young people in the 70s or 80s for example. But with the growth of social media, genderless fashion is impacting many more people on a global scale.
