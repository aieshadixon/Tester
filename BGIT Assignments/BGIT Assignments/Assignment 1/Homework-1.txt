Theory Questions

Question 1:
It stands for HyperText Markup Language and its primary purpose in web development is to be the foundation of a website. It provides a structure for the content of a website.

Question 2:
HTML elements define the content that comes inbetween an opening and closing HTML tag. They are used to provide content for every part of a webpage. Whereas HTML attributes are used in only the opening tags of an element to enhance and modify its content. An example of a HTML element would be <h1></h1> which is a heading element. An example of a HTML attribute is <img src="" alt="">, where 'src' and 'alt' are attributes of the image element.

Question 3:
The DOCTYPE declaration in an HTML document is to let the web browser know what version or type of HTML the document is written in, so that it can read and render it accurately across different browsers.
If the "DOCTYPE" declaration is omitted, the web browser will render the HTML document as something different and will lose its compatibility across different browsers as it enters into 'quirks mode'.

Question 4:
Block-level elements are elements that by default, stretch horizontally as far as they can, going beyond any inner content, and they always start on a new line. On the other hand, inline elements don't start a new line and instead allow other elements to be slotted next to them in the same line. Also, inline elements only take up as much width that is respective to them. Furthermore, block-level elements have top and bottom margines whereas, inline elements do not.
Some examples of block-level elements are: <div>, <ul>, <li>, and <nav>.
Some examples of inline elements are: <img>, <a>, <span>, and <br>.

Question 5:
Explain the significance of the following HTML tags and their usage:

<head>
This contains the metadata of the document which provides information on the title, styles, links and scripts. This information is more for machines to process information about the webpage rather than for humans to process. The content in the <head> is not displayed on the webpage when loaded onto a browser. 

<div>
This division tage serves the purpose of being a container for other elements and allows you to group certain parts of content together. They do not do anything until you style them in the CSS, and in there you can style the grouped content together as one.

<a>
This is a hyperlink which is used to link content from one webpage to another. The <a> tag is used with a href attribute that allows you to paste a URL within quotation marks to the content you want to link elsewhere.

<img>
This is to add an image to your webpage. It usualy contains a "src" attribute which is followed by a URL of the image's web address. Another attribute is "alt" which is used to provide an alternate text that describes what is depicted in the image.

<ul>, <ol>, and <li>
These are list tags and allow for text to be listed when needed. The <ul> tag is an unordered list, used when you want the list to not be in any particular order and the <ol> tag is an ordered list that numbers the text in order. <ul> and <ol> are parent tags that contain the <li> tag. The <li> tag is used to contain the name of the item in the list.


Question 6:
Semantic HTML elements outwardly describe their purpose and provide structure to a webpage. Some examples of Semantic elements are <table>, <section>, <header>, and <footer>. These elements are important for accessibility because visually impaired readers of a website will be able to understand the content as their screen readers will be able identify the structure and communicate the information to them more efficiently. Furthermore, semantic elements are important for SEO because they give the website a better chance at ranking high on the search engine results page by providing information that gives a better undertanding of the websites content from within the elements.

Question 7:
The purpose of the <form> element is to give users of a webpage a place where they can submit information that is then processed by the server. The form controls are there to serve the purpose of offereing a form of interaction between the user and the web server. Some examples of form controls are <input> elements with attributes like <input type="text">, <input type="radio">, <input type="checkbox">, <input type="submit">, and <input type="button">.  

Question 8:
To add comments in HTML you would type the following: <!-- -->. Comments are useful in web development because you can use them to explain what you did with certain code and refer to them at a later date. Also, they are helpful if someone else is looking at your code as they are able to refer to your comments that explain what you were doing with your code.

Question 9:
The HTML5 standard is the latest and final version of the Hypertext Markup language that is used to create and structure webpages with new elements, and better responsiveness. Some new features in HTML5 include video and audio features, <header> and <footer> tags, and responsive images.    

Question 10:
Responsive web design is the concept of creating webpages that are usable and viewable on any device including phones, tablets, and desktops, where the pages will automatically resize to suit the device. HTML contributes to making responsive websites by allowing the content of the website to be automatical resized by the web browser.
