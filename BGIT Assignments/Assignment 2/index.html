<p>The following are some of the places that I visited on my trip to Mallorca in 2022.</p>



<p>Cala Major is such an iconic location - for me anyway. There is so much happening in the area and everything you need is close by: Beach Restaurants Transport Supermarkets The locals are friendly and you feel this warmth from them that makes you want to return there on your next visit. 

I was captivated by the stunning views of the sea and the warm-hued sunsets in the evenings. Walking the streets of Cala Major made me feel like I was living the highlife except with the richness of LIFE. I felt really immersed in the island lifestyle.</p>

<p>Take a bus from the busy city centre of Palma de Mallorca to the charming village of Valldemossa. There you can find souvenir shops, beautiful stone buildings and gorgeous scenery. 

Visit one of the local cafes and treat yourself to a fruity and refreshing glass of sangria whilst you sit and enjoy the atmosphere. Pair it with a ..., native to Valldemossa with its bun like appearance and surprisingly sweet flavour that makes you want to eat more than one at a time. 

This place is oozing with character.</p>


<p>You can take a bus from Valldemossa to Deia. The journey involves driving along winding roads that wrap around the ... mountains. 

Be sure to sit on the left side of the bus to get the best view of the spectacular scenery outside. 

As the journey takes your higher up the mountains, you will be able to see the glistening blue waters down below.

I recommend visiting the restaurant called... It is a Thai restaurant with an amazing view that overlooks the greenery of the trees and mountains surrounding the area.</p>


<p>An hour long journey from Palma will lead you to the beautiful town of Soller.

Take a ride on the Soller train to Centre Comercial, where you will find independent shops and cafes as well as a cathedral.

I recommend going to ... which specialises in traditional Mallorquin food. There is also a weekly market that takes place every Saturday from 9am to 2pm with individual stalls selling local goods.</p>

<p>Of course the island of Mallorca has a lot more to offer, however, these are the places that I experienced.</p>
