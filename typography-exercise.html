   <header><h1>Why I Love Matcha.</h1></header> 
  <main> <div class="article-container"> <div class="highlight"><p class="article-paragraph-one">Everytime I try a new superfood - which matcha is labelled as - I research the benefits of it for my body. There is something so gratifying about knowing that you are nourishing your body with 
    foods and drinks that actually taste good. With Matcha, I found out that it is a great alternative to coffee as it delivers similar benefits with added benefits, like being high in antioxidants that can help prevent disease.

<p class="article-paragraph-two"> You should purchase either the premium grade or ceremonial grade matcha powder for better taste quality. The quality of the matcha 
powder decreases when you buy anything below those grades. Your matcha will end up being not very enjoyable.</p> <br>

<p class="article-paragraph-three">The brand of matcha that I have been loving is from the brand Clearspring. Their premium grade matcha powder is the best tasting one that iâ€™ve tried so far in my matcha journey.
